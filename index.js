// This file serves as the entry point for the Next.js application
// Next.js automatically handles the routing and rendering
// No additional code is needed here as Next.js uses the app directory structure

// The main application entry points are:
// 1. app/layout.js - Root layout component
// 2. app/page.js - Homepage component

// To start the application:
// 1. Run 'npm run dev' for development
// 2. Run 'npm run build' followed by 'npm start' for production

export { default } from './app/page';
